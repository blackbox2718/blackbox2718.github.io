Hi there, welcome to my blog! My name is Duc Vu, and I am a junior studying applied mathematics at UCLA. I previously attended Pasadena City College and transferred during Covid-19 period :(. This blog is dedicated to PIC16B, which is a course that focuses on scientific computation and data science through the study of Python. Thus, you can find here blog posts about solving computational problems as well as utilizing different Python libraries/packages to analyze and compare different tools in machine learning and computer vision. Thank you for being here and enjoy your time!

### Bonus

Since the beginning of the remote instruction period, I started to learn how to live-Tex,
which is a method/tool that compiles your latex file in real time, and gradually got it up
to the speed where I can take notes live in lecture. Since then, I have managed to put
up a collection of some of the math lecture notes that I have taken during my undergrad years
at PCC and UCLA. If you're interested, please take a look at
[this](http://tducvu.github.io/notes/). I hope you find them
helpful to study/reference and also aesthetically pleasant to look at as math can be
a very appealing subject.
